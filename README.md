Openrunner can be used for benchmark and functional testing for frontend-heavy web applications. It's a tool that simulates an end user using a website. It simulates user behaviour (keyboard/mouse activity) to browse through an online application. This can be used to test functionality and/or response times. Openrunner is a browser extension but can also be run from the command line i.e. for integration in a build pipeline.

## Getting started:

First of all, browse to https://github.com/computestdev/Openrunner/releases to download the latest release. Currently, releases come in form of a profile for Firefox. Since our plugin is not an official browser plugin yet you'll have to download Firefox Nightly: https://nightly.mozilla.org/. 

Once you have both files installed/extracted you can run Firefox with Openrunner from the command line: `<path to firefox executable> --no-remote --profile <profile directory>`

For example on OSX: `/Applications/Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox --no-remote --profile /Users/JohnDoe/Documents/openrunner-profile`

After starting you'll see Firefox with an icon of a running person in the menu bar, click this to launch the Openrunner browser extension.

Openrunner will launch with a small example script to get you started. The buttons on top of the screen can be used to open or save a script, execute or stop it. The two numbers are for the interval and the amount of runs you'd like to do (by default it's set to 1 run every 60 seconds), the last field is the current status.

After executing a script you'll be presented with the outcome. The top half of the screen shows the measured response times per step, and errors when/if they occur.

The bottom half of the screen shows the result of the run in json-format. Also, there's a 'view breakdown' button, this will open a complete breakdown of every step/event/object loaded that happened during the script execution.

Much more documentation on how to create scripts is available on the wiki on github: https://github.com/computestdev/Openrunner/wiki/Scripting-guide-(with-examples)
